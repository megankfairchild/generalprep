# generalprep
Welcome to the general exam preparation website! 
Structure of the website: 
1. The "index.html" file is the formatting of the home page. Each block on the homepage has its own individual .html file in the folder. Please only edit the index.html file if you are changing something major about the wesbite (eg, updating to add another field, add more external links, change the colors of the tiles, etc.)
2. You want to add something to an individual page - edit the individual .html file. For example, if you want to edit "Advice from previous graduate students" then open the adviceFromPreviousGradStudents.html file.
3. The top right corner menu is hard coded into each website. If you want to add or edit that menu, you will have to edit every individual page so it remains consistent.
4. This website template was downloaded from html5 UP and is called "Phantom". Thanks to them for the free templates!
